Sales Call Transcript - Demo

Rep: Good morning Sarah! This is Mike from DataFlow Solutions. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today. How are you doing?

Sarah Chen: Hi Mike, I'm doing well, thanks. I've been looking forward to this call. We've been having some challenges with our data infrastructure.

Rep: I appreciate you reaching out. Before we dive in, can you tell me a bit about your role at TechVision Analytics and what brought you to look for a solution?

Sarah Chen: Sure. I'm the Director of Data Engineering here at TechVision. We're a mid-size analytics firm with about 150 employees. We work with enterprise clients, processing their data for business intelligence and predictive analytics. The problem is, our current ETL pipeline is becoming a major bottleneck.

Rep: I see. Can you elaborate on what specific challenges you're facing with the ETL process?

Sarah Chen: Well, we're currently processing about 2 terabytes of data daily across multiple client projects. Our legacy system takes anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to complete a full pipeline run. This means we can't provide real-time or even near-real-time insights to our clients. We're also experiencing data quality issues - about 15% of our runs fail due to schema mismatches or connection timeouts.

Rep: Those are significant pain points. How is this impacting your business and your clients?

Sarah Chen: It's affecting us in multiple ways. First, we're losing competitive advantage because competitors are offering real-time dashboards while we're stuck with day-old data. Second, our engineering team spends about 30% of their time just troubleshooting pipeline failures instead of building new features. And third - this is the big one - we've lost two major clients in the past quarter who specifically cited our data latency as the reason for leaving.

Rep: That must be frustrating, especially losing clients over it. When you say 30% of engineering time, how many people are we talking about?

Sarah Chen: We have a team of 12 data engineers. So that's essentially 3.6 full-time employees just doing firefighting instead of value-added work. That's costing us roughly $450,000 annually just in wasted labor, not counting the lost revenue from those clients.

Rep: Those numbers really put it in perspective. Have you looked at other solutions before reaching out to us?

Sarah Chen: Yes, we've evaluated two other platforms. One was too expensive - they wanted $80,000 annually which our CFO rejected. The other seemed promising but their implementation timeline was 6 months, and we need something faster. We can't wait that long.

Rep: I understand the urgency. Our DataFlow platform is specifically designed to address exactly these challenges. We can typically reduce processing time by 85-90%, which would bring your 8-12 hour runs down to under 90 minutes. We also have built-in schema validation and auto-retry logic that reduces failure rates to under 2%.

Sarah Chen: That sounds impressive. What about implementation time?

Rep: Our typical implementation for a company your size is 4-6 weeks, with most clients seeing initial results within the first two weeks. We'd start with one project as a pilot, prove the value, then scale across your other pipelines.

Sarah Chen: That timeline works much better. What about pricing?

Rep: Our pricing is based on data volume and number of pipelines. For your use case - 2TB daily across what I'm assuming is 5-7 major pipelines - we're looking at approximately $45,000 annually. That includes implementation, training, and ongoing support.

Sarah Chen: That's within our budget range. The ROI is clear when you consider we're wasting $450K in engineering time alone. What would the next steps look like?

Rep: I'm glad the value proposition makes sense. Here's what I'd suggest: First, I'd like to schedule a technical deep-dive with your lead data engineer next week. We'll review your current architecture and show exactly how DataFlow would integrate. Second, we can set up a two-week proof of concept with one of your pipelines at no cost, so you can see the results firsthand before making a commitment. How does that sound?

Sarah Chen: That sounds very reasonable. A POC would definitely help me get buy-in from our CTO. Can we target our highest-volume pipeline for the POC? That's where we feel the pain most.

Rep: Absolutely. The high-volume pipeline is actually the perfect test case. It'll give you the most dramatic results. Let me check my calendar... How about I set up that technical call for next Tuesday at 2 PM? I'll bring our solutions architect, Tom, who specializes in analytics firms like yours.

Sarah Chen: Tuesday at 2 works for me. I'll bring our lead engineer, David Martinez. Should I send you any documentation about our current setup beforehand?

Rep: That would be incredibly helpful. If you could send over a high-level architecture diagram and maybe some sample data schemas, that'll let us come prepared with specific recommendations. I'll send you a calendar invite today with a prep questionnaire attached.

Sarah Chen: Perfect. I'll have David pull that together and send it over by Friday.

Rep: Excellent. Sarah, I really appreciate your time today and your transparency about the challenges you're facing. I'm confident we can help you solve these pipeline issues and get you back to focusing on innovation rather than firefighting. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?

Sarah Chen: No, I think we've covered everything. I'm looking forward to Tuesday's call.

Rep: Great! I'll send that calendar invite within the hour. Have a great rest of your day, Sarah.

Sarah Chen: You too, Mike. Thanks again.

Rep: Thank you. Talk soon!
